<BODY>

<H1>
Using CPC/IP's telnet to read and send email and posts, and to surf
</H1>

<P>
It's possible to use CPC/IP's telnet to read and send email
and posts, and even to surf the net a bit, albeit with a degree
of comfort the Spanish Inquisition would be proud of.
</P>

<H2>
General considerations
</H2>

<P>
Always use CPC/IP telnet's <KBD>-l</KBD> switch to enable line mode.
If you don't, then any mistype will probably corrupt the line being entered.
You can only send a line if the previous line has been received
by the remote side; if when you press Return CPC/IP beeps at you
and leaves the cursor where it is, then wait a bit and try again.
Typically, you'll know when the
previous line has been received by the remote side because
some kind of response will be displayed.
</P>

<P>
Generally, the procedure is to telnet to the so-called 'well-known' port
(by typing the port number after the server address) and
then to type in commands, with optional
arguments (use a single space to separate any arguments).
Commands are case-insensitive, unless otherwise specified.
Command arguments are sometimes case-sensitive; when in doubt
preserve case.  Command parameters are shown in angle brackets
below; you need to replace them with your chosen command
argument.
</P>

<P>
You sometimes need to enter sensitive information such as
passwords.  To foil all those prying eyes, use Ctrl-E before
entering the sensitive information, and Ctrl-E again when
it's been entered.
</P>

<P>
Needless to say, the information below is only the tip of
the iceberg.  For more information look at the RFCs.
If things go really really bad, then Ctrl-[ is your friend!
</P>

<H2>
Reading email using POP3
</H2>

<P>Port number: 110</P>
<P>Server address: typically <VAR>pop3.*</VAR></P>
<P>RFC: <A HREF="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1939.txt">RFC1939</A></P>

<P>
POP3 works by giving each message in your mailbox a number starting
from 1.  That number is how you tell a POP3 server which message
you want to deal with.
</P>

<H3>
Step 1: logging on
</H3>

<P>
Use <KBD>user &lt;username></KBD>
and then <KBD>pass &lt;password></KBD> to log on.
</P>

<H3>
Step 2: reading your email
</H3>

<P>
Use <KBD>stat</KBD> to get a count of the total number of messages
in your mailbox, and their total size.
Use <KBD>list</KBD> to get a list of all the messages' numbers
and sizes.
Use <KBD>retr &lt;number></KBD> to read (retrieve) a message.
Use <KBD>dele &lt;number></KBD> to mark a message for deletion;
if you change your mind you can use <KBD>rset</KBD> to unmark
all messages marked for deletion.
Use <KBD>top &lt;number> &lt;lines></KBD>, if provided by your
POP3 server, to read the first few lines of a message; this
can be useful if the message is huge and you're not sure you're
interested!
Use <KBD>quit</KBD> to disconnect.  At this point, and only at
this point, messages you marked for deletion are deleted from
your mailbox (so if your connection terminates abnormally,
before you've typed <KBD>quit</KBD>, nothing is lost).
<STRONG>Note,
however, that some POP3 servers may choose to auto-delete
any messages which have been retrieved, even if not explicitly
marked for deletion.</STRONG>
</P>

<H2>
Posting email using SMTP
</H2>

<P>Port number: 25</P>
<P>Server address: typically <VAR>mail.*</VAR> or <VAR>smtp.*</VAR></P>
<P>RFCs: <A HREF="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc0821.txt">RFC821</A>, <A HREF="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc0822.txt">RFC822</A></P>

<P>
An email message consists of a header and a body.  The header
contains the kind of stuff you get at the top of a letter: who
the message is from, who it is to, the date, etc..  SMTP
takes this message, and delivers it to the right person,
given an envelope telling it whom to send it to and who it
is from.
</P>

<H3>
Step 1: working out which SMTP server to speak to
</H3>

<P>
You can't telnet to the SMTP server without knowing which
SMTP server to telnet to.  To determine this, use CPC/IP's
DNS client: use <KBD>host -m &lt;domain></KBD>, where the
domain is the bit after the @ in the email address.  Pick
one of the mail exchanges given (preferably the one with
lowest preference number); that's the SMTP server you need
to telnet to.  If the DNS lookup fails, then you'll just
have to try the domain itself and hope for the best.
</P>

<H3>
Step 2: specifying the envelope
</H3>

<P>
OK, so you've telneted into the right SMTP server.
Use <KBD>helo &lt;domain></KBD> to say which machine you're on
and then <KBD>mail from: &lt;addr></KBD> to say who you are.
Then use <KBD>rcpt to: &lt;addr></KBD> one or more times
to say who the message is to.  Note that addresses should be
enclosed in angle brackets.
</P>

<H3>
Step 3: giving the message
</H3>

<P>
Use <KBD>data</KBD> to say that you now want to enter the message.
The message consists of the header, then a blank line, then
the body, then a line consisting of just a dot.  Any lines
starting with dots in the body should have another dot added
at the start of the line.
</P>

<P>
The header consists of lines each containing a field name, a colon
and the field value.  The fields can be in any order.
The only mandatory ones are <VAR>From</VAR>, <VAR>To</VAR>
(or some other destination specification) and <VAR>Date</VAR>.
<VAR>From</VAR> is followed by an email address, which need
not have angle brackets; <VAR>To</VAR> is the same, except
that more than one address can be given, separated by commas.
If you're lucky, then your SMTP server will accept messages
without a <VAR>Date</VAR> field, else you'll have to come
up with one of the godawful date formats allowed by RFC822.
</P>

<P>
The optional fields include <VAR>Subject</VAR>, <VAR>Reply-To</VAR>
and <VAR>cc</VAR>; the latter two are followed by one or more
addresses, like <VAR>To</VAR>.
</P>

<P>
When you've finished (don't forget the line with just a dot!),
you can just use <KBD>quit</KBD> to finish, or start again
with a fresh message to someone at the same domain, starting
with the <KBD>mail from:</KBD>.
</P>

I would like to buy a site licence for CPC/IP.
Please tell me how many cubic metres of euros would be needed.

<H2>
Reading and posting news using NNTP
</H2>

<P>Port number: 119</P>
<P>Server address: typically <VAR>news.*</VAR> or <VAR>nntp.*</VAR></P>
<P>RFCs: <A HREF="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc0977.txt">RFC977</A>, <A HREF="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1036.txt">RFC1036</A></P>

<P>
Posts are very similar to email messages in that they consist
of a header and a body.  There are a few extra fields, and
various outrageous forms allowed in email messages (especially
for email addresses) are forbidden, though.
</P>

<P>
Articles in a given group on a given NNTP server are numbered;
this number has no significance in another group or on another
NNTP server.
</P>

<H3>
Step 1: reading some news
</H3>

<P>
Use <KBD>group &lt;name></KBD> to select a group.  The
response from the NNTP server will confirm, from right to left,
the group name, the last article number in that group, and
the first article number in that group.
</P>

<P>
Use <KBD>stat &lt;number></KBD> to select a message.  Then
use <KBD>body</KBD> to retrieve that message's body,
<KBD>head</KBD> to retrieve that message's header,
and <KBD>article</KBD> to retrieve both.
Use <KBD>last</KBD> to select the previous message,
and <KBD>next</KBD> to select the next message.
</P>

<H3>
Step 2: posting some news
</H3>

<P>
Use <KBD>post</KBD> to say you want to post a message.
The content is similar to that of an email message (so it's
header then blank then body with any leading dot duplicated
then line with just dot), but there's no <VAR>To</VAR> field,
and the <VAR>Subject</VAR> field is mandatory.
The <VAR>To</VAR> field is replaced by a <VAR>Newsgroups</VAR> field,
which takes one or more comma-separated group names.
A <VAR>Path</VAR> field and a <VAR>Message-ID</VAR> field
are in principle mandatory, but just pray that your NNTP server
will insert these for you!
</P>

<P>
Incidentally, the first response from the NNTP server when you
connected to it will tell you whether you're allowed to post
or not; if it started <SAMP>200</SAMP> then you are, but if
it started <SAMP>201</SAMP> then you aren't.
</P>

<H3>
Step 3: going to bed
</H3>

<P>
Use <KBD>quit</KBD>.
</P>

<H2>
Surfing the net using HTTP
</H2>

<P>Port number: 80</P>
<P>Server address: typically <VAR>www.*</VAR></P>
<P>RFC: <A HREF="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2068.txt">RFC2068</A></P>

<P>
The WWW nowadays is 99% fluff and 1% content, and this applies
both to the sites and to the pages.  So you'll have to have
a sharp eye to spot the content among the crap as it scrolls
past.  But feel free to try.
</P>

<H3>
Step 1: fetching
</H3>

<P>
First type <KBD>GET &lt;pathname> HTTP/1.0</KBD>, where
the pathname is the bit after the hostname in the URL
(including the leading slash).  Then type <KBD>Host: &lt;hostname></KBD>.
Then enter a blank line.  All of this is case-sensitive.
The connection will automatically be closed when the page
(or error message!) has been transferred.
</P>

<P>
Incidentally, if the URL has a colon and a number after
the hostname, that indicates a non-default port number,
which you should use instead of 80.
</P>

<H3>
