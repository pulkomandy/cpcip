Bugs in CPC/IP's TCP layer
</H1>

CPC/IP's TCP layer is, sadly, not perfect.  Here are the
know bugs.  Please <A HREF="mailto:mrison@hotmail.com">tell me</A>
about any other bugs you discover!  Please distinguish between
functional and non-functional bugs, and give as much information
as possible so I can reproduce the problem.  And if you know of
or have access to some sort of TCP test suite, I'd be very interested...

<H2>
Functional bugs
</H2>

<P>
None of these are catastrophic, but...
</P>

<UL>
<LI>
There's no 2*MSL timeout; the TCP goes straight from TIME-WAIT to CLOSED
(so old segments could in principle cause trouble).
</LI>
<LI>
No check is made that the segment sent by the peer doesn't exceed
the receive window (so the app just has to lump it).
</LI>
<LI>
Simultaneous connections are not allowed (so two telnets
connecting to each other at exactly the same time will fail).
</LI>
<LI>
Bad ACKs in SYN-RECEIVED do not cause a connection reset.
</LI>
<LI>
It's not possible to make a passive open go active (so can't
go tcp_open after a tcp_listen).
</LI>
</UL>

<H2>
Non-functional bugs
</H2>

<P>
These merely make things less efficient than they could be.
</P>

<UL>
<LI>
No attention is paid to the peer's receive window (so in particular
if the peer sets this to zero CPC/IP just keeps trying every
retransmission timeout).
</LI>
<LI>
Segments partially containing old data are merely ACKed
(to coax the peer into sending just new data); any new data
is discarded.
</LI>
<LI>
Data and/or FIN received in SYN-SENT is ignored (the peer is
expected to resend it when only its SYN is ACKed).
</LI>
<LI>
Data waiting for transmission is only sent when the ESTABLISHED
state has been reached (it's not sent in segments sent in the SYN-SENT
or SYN-RECEIVED state).
</LI>
<LI>
The RTT is not measured; the retransmission timeout is
fixed at 3 seconds.
</LI>
<LI>
There's no support for urgent data.
</LI>
<LI>
CPC/IP doesn't wait for 2*MSL after booting to ensure
old segments have died off.
</LI>
<LI>
There's no protection against being left in FIN-WAIT-2 forever.
Nor is there any protection against retransmitting forever.
</LI>
</UL>

<H2>
Not bugs
</H2>

<P>
CPC/IP supports the following; not all stacks do.
</P>

<UL>
<LI>
Half-closes (closing the transmit direction but still being
able to receive until such time as the peer closes its
transmit direction too).
</LI>
<LI>
Concatenation of remaining data with a FIN.
</LI>
<LI>
Not suddenly deciding to resend old data for no apparent reason.
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
Oh, and CPC/IP will send an ACK before passing received
data to the app; this typically allows serial transfer
and handling of received data to be done in parallel.
