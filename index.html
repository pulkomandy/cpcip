<H1>
CPC/IP - A TCP/IP stack for Amstrad CPCs
</H1>

<P>
CPC/IP is an implementation of the
PPP, SLIP, IP, ICMP, UDP, TCP, DNS, TFTP, HTTP, ping, finger and telnet
protocols for
<A HREF="http://www.multimania.com/genesis8/faq/amstrad.txt">Amstrad CPC</A>
computers with an Amstrad, Pace or
CPC Amstrad International serial interface.
The code occupies <A HREF="memmap.txt">about 14K</A>,
excluding the serial, filing system and IP buffers,
but including all the clients and servers and their buffers/data.
</P>

<H2>
What's new?
</H2>

<UL>
<LI>
2001-06-03 (<A HREF="#sourcezip">CPC/IP v0.20</A>)
<BR>
CPC/IP makes a comeback!  The <A HREF="tcp.txt">TCP layer</A> has
been radically overhauled to present a proper API, have a proper
state machine, and a retransmission timeout.  The <A HREF="ppp.txt">
PPP</A> layer has a workaround for buggy PPP implementations.
The <A HREF="telnet.txt">telnet client</A> now supports a line mode,
including echo suppression; it's quite feasible to
<A HREF="telprot.html">use this to send/receive email/news</A>.
The <A HREF="serialdd.txt">serial device driver</A> now supports
the CPC Amstrad International serial interface.
</LI>
<LI>
2000-10-15 (CPC/IP v0.12)
<BR>
Improve portability by introducing a
<A HREF="stdio.txt">standard I/O API</A>
(use this in the <A HREF="httpd.txt">HTTP server</A>
(fixes problem with serving binary files);
note the <A HREF="tftpd.txt">TFTP server</A>
has not been updated yet).
Extend the <A HREF="serialdd.txt">Amstrad serial interface device driver</A>
to support polling, parity, more stop bits and not using hardware flow control
(no hardware flow control is now the default for the executable).
Extend the <A HREF="config.txt">configuration</A> to allow
finer control over the components included in the build.
Add <A HREF="#port">some hints on starting a port</A>.
Tweak head in <A HREF="cpcsutils.html">cpcsutils</A>
to support files bigger than 64K.
</LI>
<LI>
2000-07-02
<BR>
Update the <A HREF="#zmac">Z80 assembler</A>.
</LI>
<LI>
2000-03-12 (CPC/IP v0.11)
<BR>
Improve <A HREF="ppp.txt">PPP layer</A>: make more robust against
remote rejection, add requesting of DNS server address to use, and
add peer PPP tickle (use Copy to send this, immediately after the
physical link has been established).
Update the <A HREF="#zmac">Z80 assembler</A>.
</LI>
<LI>
2000-02-29
<BR>
I wanted to release something on this cool date, but
unfortunately I was ill.  Oh, well...
</LI>
<LI>
2000-01-23 (CPC/IP v0.10)
<BR>
Add support for <A HREF="ppp.txt">PPP</A> (but <A HREF="slip.txt">SLIP</A>
remains the default for the executable for now).
Add support for 64K machines
(this is now the default for the executable) in
the <A HREF="serialdd.txt">Amstrad serial interface device driver</A>
and <A HREF="loopback.txt">loopback driver</A>.
The <A HREF="telnet.txt">telnet</A> client now reports when
the connection has been established (incidentally, you can
now enter a bare CR (i.e. not a CRLF) using Enter).
Note you'll need to recompile <A HREF="#zmac">ZMAC 1.1.1.2</A>
with MAXIFS on line 55
#defined to 1024, say, if you want to use that to assemble CPC/IP;
I haven't tried assembling CPC/IP with Maxam for quite
a while now!
Also, the config stuff has moved one byte up (in case you're
using a loader to set things like your address and DNS server,
or DNS zone, or hosts.txt) and all the config stuff which used
to be in <A HREF="main.txt">main.z</A>
is now in <A HREF="config.txt">config.z</A>.
</LI>
<LI>
2000-01-01 (CPC/IP v0.09)
<BR>
Nothing to report.  It's not even clear CPC/IP v0.09 ever existed.
Ask <A HREF="http://www.arm.com/">ARM</A> about the ARM4 and ARM5
for more details.
</LI>
<LI>
1999-12-19 (CPC/IP v0.08)
<BR>
Add <A HREF="resolv.txt">resolver</A> and
<A HREF="host.txt">nameserver lookup client</A>;
default nameserver is 127.0.0.1 (localhost).
Speed up <A HREF="telnet.txt">telnet</A>
<A HREF="cons.txt">console</A> output.
Add nameserver address and domain name to
<A HREF="config.txt">configuration</A>; the nameserver address
can be set with the <A HREF="ifconfig.txt">ifconfig module</A>.
A few miscellaneous little bug fixes.
</LI>
<LI>
1999-11-28 (CPC/IP v0.07, the birthday release!)
<BR>
Release <A HREF="httpd.txt">tipi, the HTTP/0.9 server</A>.
Improve the <A HREF="tcp.txt">TCP layer</A>, so it's at least plausible.
Improve <A HREF="telnet.txt">telnet</A>, in particular so it can function
as a <A HREF="cons.txt">console</A>
(with <A HREF="cpc.tmi">a suitable terminfo</A>).
There's a <A HREF="hosts.txt">hosts.txt-like mechanism</A>,
which the clients now use.
Add <A HREF="cpcaisio.txt">driver for the CPC Amstrad International serial
interface</A>, courtesy of Tim RIEMANN.
Note the code is now loaded at &amp;3800 with HIMEM at &amp;27ff,
CPC/IP's <A HREF="config.txt">default IP address</A> is now 192.168.6.128,
Ctrl-[ should be used to abort a telnet connection,
and Ctrl-Esc should be used to quit CPC/IP -- or use the new quit command.

<A HREF="ping.txt">ping</A> and (basic) <A HREF="telnet.txt">telnet</A>
clients added.  <A HREF="loopback.txt">Loopback</A> support added.
<A HREF="tcp.txt">TCP</A> layer still exceedingly rudimentary!
<A HREF="icmp.txt">ICMP</A> checksums now fully supported.
The <A HREF="#cli">command-line interface</A> has been extended
to support multiple clients.

Some of these limitations make this implementation non-compliant as per

<A HREF="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1123.txt">RFC1123</A>.

All the IP option fields.  They are ignored.

Oh, and
<A HREF="http://www.ntk.net/index.cgi?back=archive00/now0128.txt&amp;line=110#l">

</P>

<H2>
Portability
</H2>

<P>
Although CPC/IP officially only supports Amstrad CPCs
with Amstrad serial interfaces, it should work on compatible
systems.  The important points are that
</P>

<UL>
<LI>
The serial chip must be Z80-DART-compatible, and be located
at &amp;fadc/fadd.  The chip's interrupt line must be connected.
</LI>
<LI>
The clock generator must be CTC-8253-compatible
and be located at &amp;fbdc/fbdd/fbdf.  It must be clocked
at 2&nbsp;MHz.
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
Note the Pace serial interface satisfies these requirements,
except that the interrupt line is not connected.  It
must therefore be polled.  In turn, this means the datarate
should be 4800 bps (though 9600 bps may be achievable if
8E2 or maybe just 8N2 framing is used -- it is in fact only
necessary to use two stop bits on the remote side, so you
might be able to get away with 8N1 on the CPC).  You will need to
make appropriate changes in <A HREF="config.txt">config.z</A>
and rebuild.
</P>

<P>
The serial interface which appeared in CPC Amstrad International
1992-06/07 is also believed to be supported (untested);
you'll need to make appropriate changes in
<A HREF="config.txt">config.z</A> and rebuild to use this.
</P>

<P>
If you want to use the full 128K, then if your machine isn't
a CPC6128 the important point is that
</P>

<UL>
<LI>
The 128K must be selectable using OUT (&amp;7fxx), &amp;cx.  
32K is used for rx/tx buffers and 16K is used for a loopback buffer;
the rest may be used in the future to
hide most of the code out of the main 64K.
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
Failing all this, though, it shouldn't be very difficult to port the
system-dependent bits to a different system.
</P>

<H2>
How to use
</H2>

<P>
(The following assumes connection to a Linux box, and specifically
to the version of Linux which happens to be on my box at home.
I'm not a Linux guru, so it's unlikely I'll be able to help if
the Linux bits don't work for you or make no sense!
You can also connect straight
to an ISP via a modem (ignoring all the bits about setting up the peer),
as long as, if you're using SLIP, you use <KBD>ifconfig</KBD> to set your
IP address everytime if your ISP gives out non-static IP addresses.
Note: the Amstrad serial interface, at least, won't receive
unless Carrier Detect is active, if hardware flow control is being used.
The CPCAI serial interface won't ever receive if Carrier Detect is
inactive, even if hardware flow control isn't being used!
If you can't get your modem to
force it active via a DIP switch, you'll have to type "AT&amp;C0" blind
to do so in software.)

</UL>
<LI>
Remember, if you're trying to transfer a binary file to a CPC it
must end up with an AMSDOS header.
Put an AMSDOS header on using something like
"head&nbsp;main.bin&nbsp;-l3800&nbsp;-fcpcip.bin&nbsp;>cpcip.bin"
(see <A HREF="cpcsutils.html">cpcsutils</A> for head).
You can then transfer the file using
"A$&nbsp;=&nbsp;"cpcip.bin"&nbsp;:&nbsp;|SUCK,&nbsp;@a$"
on the CPC and "blow&nbsp;cpcip.bin" (from the same package) on the source box,
or tftp (remember to use binary mode!) if you've already managed to get
just about any version of CPC/IP on your Amstrad CPC.
</LI>
<LI>
Set up the serial port on the peer.  You'll need to:
<UL>
<LI>
Set the serial port to use 8&nbsp;data bits, no parity, and 1&nbsp;stop bit.
I think this is normally the default, which is a good thing because
I don't know where or how to change it (though I suspect suitable stty
lines somewhere in /etc/rc.boot/0setserial might do the trick)!
</LI>
<LI>
Edit /etc/inittab to allow connection via this serial port,
at 9600&nbsp;bps (or 2400&nbsp;bps if using the CPC Amstrad International
serial interface) and using hardware flow control, if appropriate.
This is what I've got:
<BR>
T1:23:respawn:/sbin/getty -L -h ttyS1 9600
</LI>
<LI>
Use /sbin/init&nbsp;q to cause this file to be reparsed
(only necessary the first time).
</LI>
</UL>
</LI>
<LI>
Launch CPC/IP!  "CALL&nbsp;&amp;3800".  You should see a login prompt.
Log in using any account, to check the serial link is working OK.
Log out.
</LI>
<LI>
Set up SLIP or PPP on the peer.
If you want to use PPP, you're probably best off
<A HREF="mailto:mrison@hotmail.com">contacting me</A> for further
details.  If you want to have a go on your own, be aware that
(a) the peer needs to support PAP, if it wants to authenticate,
and you need to enter your PAP details in <A HREF="config.txt">config.z</A>,
(b) there are no timeouts in the current implementation, so it
could all just seize up,
(c) there are no state checks in the current implementation, so it
could all go haywire,
(d) I would dare to suggest there's a bug in pppd version 2.3 patch level 5,
which means you should turn off Van Jacobson compression (using "novj")
(e) I've put in a workaround for buggy PPP implementations which
unfortunately means that should the remote side send spurious control
characters they won't be filtered out,
(f) the local address and DNS server to use will automatically
be requested (but can subsequently be overridden using <KBD>ifconfig</KBD>).
For SLIP you'll need to:
<UL>
<LI>
Create a suitable account using adduser.
</LI>
<LI>
Make this account use /usr/sbin/sliplogin as its shell.
</LI>
<LI>
Suitably edit /etc/slip.hosts (use DYNAMIC as the remote address).
</LI>
<LI>
Suitably edit /etc/slip.tty (to specify your CPC's address).
</LI>
<LI>
Modify /etc/slip.login to make the MTU 1006 (CPC/IP would support 1023
but this is the Berkeley SLIP limit).
</LI>
<LI>
Make sure /usr/sbin/sliplogin is setuid (use "chmod&nbsp;u+s" if not)
and the SLIP account has execute permission (fiddle with /etc/group if not).
</LI>
<LI>
Add your CPC to /etc/hosts using the address you allocated (optional).
</LI>
</UL>
Alternatively, you could use slattach and ifconfig (as root), if you
can work out the parameters (it's not particle physics).  Here
is a hint:
<BR>
slattach -L -p slip -s 9600 /dev/ttyS0 &amp;
<BR>
ifconfig sl0 192.168.4.86 pointopoint 192.168.6.128 up mtu 1006
</LI>
<LI>
Go back to your CPC.  Log in using the SLIP account.
<A NAME="cli">You should now be able to use the stack</A>:
<UL>
<LI>
You should be able to ping your CPC.
</LI>
<LI>
You should be able to transfer files to your CPC using TFTP
on the remote machine.
The filename should be AMSDOS-friendly, your disc should have
enough free space, etc.  Transferring files from your CPC using TFTP isn't
possible yet, unfortunately.
</LI>
<LI>
You should be able to fetch files from your CPC using tipi,
the HTTP/0.9 server.
The URL to use is just what you'd expect; something like
http://sugar/index.htm .  Note if you're serving non-ASCII
files, they should have AMSDOS headers;
head from <A HREF="cpcsutils.html">cpcsutils</A> may be useful!
</LI>
<LI>
You should be able to make DNS queries regarding the
bufo-house.org domain using rind,
the Retro Internet Name Daemon.
Type things like "host&nbsp;-a&nbsp;cpc&nbsp;[CPC]"
and "host&nbsp;-a&nbsp;bufo-house.org&nbsp;[CPC]", where [CPC] is
your CPC's IP address, on the remote machine.
To use your own choice of DNS information, you can rebuild CPC/IP after
changing <A HREF="dnsd.txt">dnsd.z</A>, or you can load a DNS zone
file into memory and place the base address at &amp;380d.
</LI>
<LI>
To use any of the clients CPC/IP will have to realise/believe a SLIP
connection has been established (shown by the presence of a
command-line prompt ("> ")).  One way to do so is to ping
your CPC once.  Another is to press Copy.
</LI>
<LI>
In all the clients you can use textual addresses defined
in <A HREF="hosts.txt">hosts.z</A>.  By default these are
localhost (127.0.0.1), sugar (192.168.6.128) and
koaks (192.168.4.86).
To use your own choice of hosts, you can rebuild CPC/IP after
changing <A HREF="hosts.txt">hosts.z</A>, or you can load a
hosts.txt file into memory and place the base address at &amp;3807.

If you want to change your CPC's address (only important for
clients and if you didn't suitably set this in the source/executable
if you don't want to use the default 192.168.6.128)
you can use <KBD>ifconfig</KBD>.  As for all the clients, you can
get the syntax by entering the command name on its own.
Note the clients may be more permissive regarding syntax than
the syntax help would suggest; you should not rely on any
short-cuts you find working in future versions of CPC/IP!
</LI>
<LI>
If you want to set the nameserver you can also use <KBD>ifconfig</KBD>.
The default nameserver is 127.0.0.1 (localhost, your CPC), which
doesn't serve much!  The nameserver should preferably support
recursive queries, because the resolver doesn't!
</LI>
<LI>
You should be able to finger other machines from your CPC.
Remember by default there's no world-wide nameserver,
so you'll have to type numeric addresses!
You can use Ctrl-C to abort a connection.
</LI>
<LI>
You should be able to ping other machines from your CPC.
This is one of the only three things you can ("usefully") do without a
serial interface: specify a loopback address such as 127.0.0.1.
Note the numeric parameters in this command should be less
than 256.
You can use Ctrl-C to abort pinging.
</LI>
<LI>
You can also make nameserver queries using host; this is the second thing
you can do without a serial interface.  For a hostname, you can either get
all the numeric addresses corresponding to it,
or all DNS information (using -a), or mail
exchange information (using -m).  You can also do reverse lookups
on numeric addresses.
You can use Ctrl-C to abort a lookup.
</LI>
<LI>
You should be able to telnet to other machines from your
CPC.  You can use Ctrl-[ to abort a connection.
You can <A HREF="telprot.html">use this to fetch a page locally
from tipi</A>; this is the third and last thing you can do
without a serial interface.  If you're connected to the Internet,
though, <A HREF="telprot.html">then you can use telnet to
send and receive email and news, and even surf the net</A>!
Also, install <A HREF="cpc.tmi">this terminfo file</A> using "tic cpc.tmi"
(as root),
select it using "export&nbsp;TERM=cpc" or your shell's equivalent,
and you'll have a fully-functional console.
The arrow keys work; Ctrl-Left/Right will do Home/End,
Ctrl-Up/Down will do Page Up/Down, Clr will do Delete/Clear, Esc will
do Esc, and Ctrl-Tab will do Insert.
</LI>
<LI>
There is a resolver which the clients automatically use if the
address given isn't numeric and isn't in
<A HREF="hosts.txt">hosts.txt</A>.  This will
automatically append the domain name specified in
<A HREF="config.txt">config.z</A> -- "bufo-house.org"
by default (rebuild to use yours!) -- to addresses without dots.
If you need to make
sure this doesn't happen for any reason, make the address
absolute by putting a dot at the end.
DNS is a bit of a monster, and so the resolver may well go
wrong!  If it does, please <A HREF="mailto:mrison@hotmail.com">tell me</A>,
specifying the nameserver you were using and the query you were making
(the address you were trying to resolve).
</LI>
<LI>
Press Ctrl-Esc to escape from CPC/IP.  (If after acquiring a SLIP
link you find you need to use CPC/IP as a terminal again
(e.g. because your link fell over), press Copy.)

What next?
</H2>

<P>
If you like what you see, and would like things to go further,
then please get in touch.  If no-one cares, there's not much
point (although it's quite an educational experience implementing
the protocols).
</P>

<P>
As you will see if you look at the code, it's reasonably
well structured (within the limitations of Maxam), and hooking
in new stuff shouldn't be too difficult.  The most interesting
bit will be to work out how to allow things to hook in and then
be called in the background.  I've been thinking of schemes
using OS events, but nothing's very firm yet.  Currently the
serial device driver is interrupt-driven, but the protocol
stack is essentially polling-driven.

I don't know very much about the Internet protocols
(just about all I know comes from reading the RFCs), and I
could do with advice (for instance, which IP options and
ICMP messages are, realistically, worth implementing?).

Perhaps CPC/IP could become PCW/IP or S128/IP?  The most important
point to consider here is that CPC/IP uses both IX and IY.
